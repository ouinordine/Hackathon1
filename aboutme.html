        <p class="aboutp">
            Passionate about the world of information technology, I am an aspiring software developer currently studying software engineering at Power Learn Project (PLP). My journey is driven by passion for IT and a desire to transform ideas into innovative digital solutions.
            <br><br>
            My experience has been enriched through an attachment as an IT support technician at the Kenya National Highway Authorities (KeNHA). This opportunity allowed me to acquire essential practical skills, understand the challenges of technical support, and develop a keen sense of problem-solving.
            <br><br>
            My goal is to use my skills to create high-performance applications and software that meet the specific needs of each user while continiung learning and enjoying what I do. Feel free to contact me to discuss your projects or for any collaboration.
            <br><br>
            Together, let's explore the endless possibilities of the digital world!
